This script provides 3 functions that handle different aspects of preprocessing text:
- clean_text(): removes punctuation and changes all text input to lowercase
- tokenize_text(): splits the input string based on spaces and returns a list of tokens
- count_words(): tallies the instances of words in the text and returns a dictionary of words and frequencies.
